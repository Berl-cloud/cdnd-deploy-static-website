# Deploy Static Website on AWS

This is the first project of Cloud Developer Nanodegree Project. In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS using S3 bucket, 
CloudFront, and IAM policies.

## Steps Performed:
    I created a public S3 bucket and uploaded the website files to my bucket.
    I configured the bucket for website hosting and secured it using IAM policies.

    I accessed the website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.
